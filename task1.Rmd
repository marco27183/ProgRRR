This R Markdown document is an outline to be used for the test of
_Programming with R for Reproducible Research_. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring web pages (click the **Help** toolbar button for more ..).
__do__ keep the first R chunk above which should ensure some reproducibility.

Do ensure that clicking the **Knit HTML** button in Rstudio works in creating a web page including both content as well as the output of the embedded R code chunks. Notably you need to have installed the `knitr` R package (before the test, please). You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
print(pi, digits=15)
```
